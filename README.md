# AI Study Companion

An AI-powered study assistant designed to help with learning, summarizing, and organizing study materials. This project combines Python tools and structured resources to build a smart companion for students.


## 🧠 About

AI Study Companion is built as a **personal learning assistant** that supports:

- 📚 Managing & organizing study materials  
- 🧠 Retrieval of concepts via vector search  
- 🛠️ Modular code for extensibility  
- 📊 Notebook-style exploration using workbooks

> The project is structured to make future integrations (like embeddings, RAG search, and UI) easy to add.

## 🚀 Features

**Core Directories**
- `src/` — Main application source code
- `vector_Store/` — Stores embeddings and vectors for semantic search
- `workbooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration & demos
- `books/` — PDF/text resources used for study or ingestion

**Configuration**
- `.env` — Environment variables (keep secure & not committed)
- `requirements.txt` — Lists Python packages your project depends on

## 📦 Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python  
- 📌 Vector Store (for semantic retrieval)  
- 📓 Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation
